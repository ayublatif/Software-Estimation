This link contains two popular datasets on agile software development, they are cited in the research paper. The dataset file augmented_project_data1.csv is the augmented version of the time estimation dataset
and contains 126 projects. The effort_estimation_dataset.csv comprises of 136 projects and is used for effort estimation. The python file by the name of TheNewGUI.py, creates a GUI for user to enter details of 
a project and get the output of the predicted time through four ML models of LR, SVR, RF and XGBoost. The other python file by the name of KNNTime.py preforms the validation of the prodiction uses leave one out 
mechanism and calculates the MRE and the MMRE and Pred(25) counts for all 126 projects for time and utilized the time datastet. The python file TheLastEffort.py validates the 136 records of the effort estimation 
and calculate their MMRE and Pred(25) counts.
